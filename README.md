# class-timepy

This is a project i finished in an hour. I wanted to automate the creation of the timetable for my classes, since it's something very tedious i wanted to automate it! It's far from perfect visually speaking but i can make the final touches manually really quickly. Especially abbreviation of the subject names it's something not easily feasible without some sort of AI

The input is the time table found on the online services, pasted onto a .txt file

After some final manual touches this is the table i use everyday
